# Post-Processing of EMG Decomposition Results from DEMUSE

This repository contains scripts for post-processing the decomposition results of EMG signals (HD-sEMG or iEMG) obtained from [DEMUSEÂ®](https://demuse.feri.um.si/) or from custom-written decomposition algorithms, provided that the results are saved in a format similar to DEMUSE.

These scripts (and others) were used in my [**MSc Thesis at Politecnico di Torino**](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/33655/), which focused on analyzing Motor Unit (MU) behavior and functional performance in patients with brachial plexus injuries following nerve transfer surgery.
